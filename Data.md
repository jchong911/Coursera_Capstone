# Data
The data that we will be using is based on the csv file by Kaggle located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009). Please take note that with this data we will only be comparing different kinds of red and white wines only. Also, please take note that we can only compare the "quality" of the wines, not the future prices of red wine. There will also be no comparison of brands of red and white wine.
