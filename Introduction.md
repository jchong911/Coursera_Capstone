# Introduction
Alcohol is enjoyed by many as a way to destress after a long day of working. According to the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health](https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm)
, "86.3 percent of people ages 18 or older reported that they drank alcohol at some point in their lifetime; 70.0 percent reported that
they drank in the past year; 55.3 percent reported that they drank in the past month." This tells us that most people would like to drink
alcohol during their breaks, but of all the alcohol present in our daily lives, what is the most prominent alcohol people usually drink?
In a 2018 survey made by the [Statista Global Consumer Survey](https://www.statista.com/customercloud/global-consumer-survey) 38.7% of people
aged 18 to 29 would choose to drink wine over different alcoholic beverage. What is wine? Wine is a kind of alcoholic beverage made by fermented 
juices of grapes. Wine can be of different colors, textures, and fermentations, and can vary in results. In this project, we will be looking at how 
does a wine qualify as "good wine" and what kind of fermentation, flavor, and scent can wines have in order to know what type of wine can be a "perfect" wine.
