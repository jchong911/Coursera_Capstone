# Introduction
Alcohol is enjoyed by many as a way to destress after a long day of working. According to the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health](https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm)
, "86.3 percent of people ages 18 or older reported that they drank alcohol at some point in their lifetime; 70.0 percent reported that
they drank in the past year; 55.3 percent reported that they drank in the past month." This tells us that most people would like to drink
alcohol during their breaks, but of all the alcohol present in our daily lives, what is the most prominent alcohol people usually drink?
In a 2018 survey made by the [Statista Global Consumer Survey](https://www.statista.com/customercloud/global-consumer-survey) 38.7% of people
aged 18 to 29 would choose to drink wine over different alcoholic beverage. What is wine? Wine is a kind of alcoholic beverage made by fermented 
juices of grapes. Wine can be of different colors, textures, and fermentations, and can vary in results. 

# Problem
Wine has different kind of processing. As stated by the [Wine Month Club](https://www.winemonthclub.com/the-wine-making-process), there are five steps
in making wine. These are "harvesting", "crushing and pressing", "fermentation", "clarification", and "aging and bottling". In this project, we will be looking at
what kind of processes can increase the quality of wine. If so, based on the info, what process can hypothetically make the best quality of wine.

# Interest
Of course, with this information, people who are part of the wine making business may be interested so that they would know what to cut down from
and what dop they need to improve so that thye can produce wine with the best quality. Sommeliers (wine stewards), wine testers, or even people who
have a hobby of drinking iwne may be interested with the information.
